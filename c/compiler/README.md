## Compilation Process

1. Lexing
2. Parsing
3. Traversing
4. Compiling
5. Executing

### Lexing

Each source code file is broken down into. These tokens can take the following forms:


| Token      | Type           |
| :----------: |:-------------:|
| String      | Literal |
| Number (float/int) (B/O/D/H) |
