# Guardian

Guardian is a statically typed, object-oriented programming language, with a particular focus on providing a new and more complete set of tools for blockchain applications.
## Aims

In no particular order, the Guardian programming language strives to be:

- Executionally deterministic
- Memory safe
- Fully supportive of concurrency
- Simple and easy to learn

## Key Features

###  Concurrency

### Contracts

In the event of a ```terminate(args)``` call, the contract will be, and the state of all variables will be reset to their input values. This is tantamount to each operation being performed within a transaction.
